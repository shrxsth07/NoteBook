Notebook Web App

This is a straightforward notebook web application built with React that allows you to easily create, edit, and manage your notes in one place. To start the project and run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously, simply use the command `npm run both`. This will launch the app in development mode and open it in your default browser for quick and easy access.
